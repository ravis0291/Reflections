1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

An empty repository is created when you initialize. A repository is necessary for git to perform all its operations.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It provides a temporary space which makes it possible to see which files are going to be included in the commit.
The working directory contains all files which might not be a part of the commit.
